# Instructions
1. Download the file at https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/edition-changer specific to your version
2. Unzip the folder
3. Download Blockbench at https://www.blockbench.net/downloads
4. Download it and then click on "Minecraft Title"
5. Make the text say whatever you want
    5-1. MAKE SURE TO MAKE THE TEXT NOT TOO LONG*
6. Make sure the text looks fine to you, then click "Render" on the right side of your screen.
7. After you've confirmed it looks good, click the red camera button at the bottom that reads "Render Minecraft Title"
8. At the top, click "Custom, then unclick the linked paperclip icon next to the resolution, then change the resolution to 512x64
    8-1. For 1.12.2-1.19.4, the resolution MUST be 128x16, this means your text must be way smaller (i mean very small)
    8-2. *This is exactly why I told you to not make the text too long.
9. Click "Save Render" then save it as "edition.png" (It may be case sensitive)
10. Put the saved image inside the folder, under assets\minecraft\textures\gui\title, and replace the current "edition.png" with your new edition.png
    10-1. If it asks you to replace the image, do it.
11. Put the folder inside '.minecraft\resourcepacks' if you havent already.
12. Launch Minecraft. Then go to 'Options', then 'Resource Packs', then put on the resource pack and let it do its thing.
    12-1. This should work on any modloader, from Optifine, Forge, Neoforge, heck even Rift if you will!
13. Go to your main screen, and admire your creation.
