# Instructions
1. Download the file at https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/edition-changer specific to your version
2. Unzip the folder
3. Download Blockbench at https://www.blockbench.net/downloads
4. Follow the download process, and then once you've completed it, open BlockBench. (this isnt malware, I have it on my pc)
5. Once it has opened, click on "Minecraft Title"
6. Make the text say whatever you want. ANYTHING!
7. Make sure the text looks fine to you, then click "Render" on the right side of your screen.
8. After you've confirmed it looks good, click the red camera button at the bottom that reads "Render Minecraft Title"
9. At the top, click "Minecraft". It will auto default to 1.20's default texture, so if you want 1.19 and below, make sure to click the drag and drop and select that!
10. Click "Save Render" then save it as "edition.png" (It may be case sensitive)
11. Put the saved image inside the folder, under assets\minecraft\textures\gui\title, and replace the current "edition.png" with your new edition.png
    11-1. If it asks you to replace the image, do it.
12. Put the folder inside '.minecraft\resourcepacks' if you havent already.
13. Launch Minecraft. Then go to 'Options', then 'Resource Packs', then put on the resource pack and let it do its thing.
    13-1. This should work on any modloader, from Optifine, Forge, Neoforge, heck even Rift if you will!
14. Go to your main screen, and admire your creation.
